### Some notes

#### On Developer Hub

We observerd some issues with the developer hub, on first boot where the database migration fails. See this [issue](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/24284). To resolve the issue, we had to manually remove the offending record from the database. On the Postgresql pod, run the following command:

```shell
# connect to the database
psql

# select the database
\c backstage_plugin_catalog

# delete the offending record
DELETE FROM knex_migrations_lock WHERE is_locked <> 0;
COMMIT;

\q
```
